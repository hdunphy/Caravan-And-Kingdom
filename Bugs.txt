Completed:
1. Starvation is too punishing and they don't seem to be able to find an equilibrium.
2. Carvans should log their return haul to the console.
3. Stop debugging resources in the console.
4. Remove the carvan button
5. Show all factions on a leaderboard to the right. Make the settings view a modal.
6. Ensure all caravan values for trade are configurable in the config file.
7. Caravans don't enter the city, they just make it to the territory. Also they should pause to load/unload
8. Agents cannot move through water this needs to be fixed.
9. Each terrain should have a movement cost. If they don't they need to be updated. If they do they don't seem to be used
10. I don't think the movement speed is being used. Agents travel too fast.
11. Maintenance needs to be added to the game config
12. Building bonuses need to be added to the game config
13. AI logic is becoming spaghetti code. It needs to be refactored. Also surplus values are hardcoded -> move them out to game config
14. Do settlers take pop from settlement. They do not I added a settler cost.

TODO:
15. Investigate Vitest runner crash in WSL environment (esbuild socket error).
