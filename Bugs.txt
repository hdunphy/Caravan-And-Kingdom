Completed:
1. Starvation is too punishing and they don't seem to be able to find an equilibrium.
2. Carvans should log their return haul to the console.
3. Stop debugging resources in the console.

5. Show all factions on a leaderboard to the right. Make the settings view a modal.
6. Ensure all caravan values for trade are configurable in the config file.
7. Caravans don't enter the city, they just make it to the territory. Also they should pause to load/unload
8. Water needs to be impassable for agents (Fixed: Enforced in Pathfinding default config + system calls).
9. Each terrain should have a movement cost (Fixed: Verified usage in Pathfinding).
10. I don't think the movement speed is being used (Fixed: Pathfinding respects costs, MovementSystem follows path).
11. Maintenance needs to be added to the game config (Fixed: Done in Milestone Refactoring).
12. Building bonuses need to be added to the game config (Fixed: Done in Milestone Refactoring).
13. AI logic is becoming spaghetti code (Fixed: Refactored into Strategy classes).
