## Feature Development: Diplomacy
- **Phase 1 Plan:** Agreed to implement a Faction Relationship Matrix.
- **Relationship Triggers:**
    - **Border Friction:** Relationship decay when factions own hexes within 3 units of each other.
    - **Trade Boons:** Relationship boost upon successful caravan trade.
- **Goal:** Break the "Miserly Village" stagnation and create dynamic faction interactions.

## Evolution Marathon: Batch 5 Analysis
- **"Ghost Town" Phenomenon:** In 25,000-tick runs (Gen 165), factions evolve to reach Tier 1 (Town) and hoard wealth (60k+ Gold) but eventually starve to near-zero population (0.0006). High fitness is maintained due to wealth/tier buffs, but growth is stagnant.
- **Tier 2 Bottleneck:** The 400-population requirement for Tier 2 (City) remains unreached. 
- **Evolved Constraints:** High `tradeRoiThreshold` (~825) and `provisionDistanceMulti` (~55) prioritize hoarding and local safety over growth and survival through trade.
- **New Run (Gen 34):** A fresh restart is currently at Generation 34. Showing high mortality (1/3 survivors) and a consistent 100-population ceiling.

## Technical Milestones
- **Priority Summing:** Verified as fully operational in `GOAPPlanner.ts`. Resource gathering priorities are aggregated from multiple settlement desires.
- **Sovereign AI:** Factions are successfully operating as independent entities with jittered update intervals.
- **Bug Squashing:** Currently cleaning up villager dispatch and ant-logic edge cases.
