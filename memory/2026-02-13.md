## Feature Development: Diplomacy
- **Phase 1 Plan:** Agreed to implement a Faction Relationship Matrix.
- **Relationship Triggers:**
    - **Border Friction:** Relationship decay when factions own hexes within 3 units of each other.
    - **Trade Boons:** Relationship boost upon successful caravan trade.
- **Goal:** Break the "Miserly Village" stagnation and create dynamic faction interactions.

## Evolution Marathon: Batch 8 & 9 Results
- **Status:** Batch 9 concluded at Gen 200.
- **Breakthrough:** Successfully reached **Tier 2 (City)** in multiple generations.
- **Population Peak:** Hit a zenith of **581 population** (Gen 11, Batch 8) and **437 population** (Gen 198, Batch 9).
- **Remaining Issues:** 
    - **Trade ROI Paradox:** `tradeRoiThreshold` continues to evolve to mathematically impossible levels (>600), effectively disabling trade and causing "Wealthy Ghost Towns" (Factions with 60k+ gold but 0 population winning on fitness).
    - **Logistics Retrieval Wall:** At Tier 2 (City scale), villagers physically cannot retrieve remote food fast enough to support 500+ people using current "Ant Logic."

## Feature Development: Diplomacy & Logistics
- **Phase 1 Plan:** Implement a Faction Relationship Matrix (Neutral/Friendly/Hostile).
- **New Requirement:** Change `tradeRoiThreshold` from a flat gold value to a percentage-based ROI to prevent genetic "trade-deletion."
- **New Requirement:** Implement a "Granary" or "Warehouse" local drop-off logic to buff food retrieval for large cities.
