## Feature Development: Diplomacy
- **Phase 1 Plan:** Agreed to implement a Faction Relationship Matrix.
- **Relationship Triggers:**
    - **Border Friction:** Relationship decay when factions own hexes within 3 units of each other.
    - **Trade Boons:** Relationship boost upon successful caravan trade.
- **Goal:** Break the "Miserly Village" stagnation and create dynamic faction interactions.

## Evolution Marathon: Batch 6 Results
- **Status:** Concluded at Gen 200.
- **Trade Lock:** SUCCESSFULLY BROKEN. `tradeRoiThreshold` evolved down to ~35, making trade functional.
- **Population:** Still stuck at the ~100 cap. 
- **Tier 2 Bottleneck:** Confirmed as a physical logistics limitation. Settlements rely too heavily on the center hex for direct food deposits; villagers cannot retrieve remote food piles fast enough to support 400+ population.
- **Current State:** Simulation is IDLE.

## Technical Milestones
- **Priority Summing:** Verified as fully operational in `GOAPPlanner.ts`.
- **Logistics Diagnosis:** Identifying that "remote extraction" depositing resources on the ground creates a retrieval bottleneck that limits urban growth.
