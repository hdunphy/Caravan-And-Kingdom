## GA Marathon Status
- **Issue:** Background simulations in OpenClaw were hitting log buffer limits (20,000 tick runs).
- **Resolution:** Moved simulation to Lord Dunphy's local machine via a Windows `.bat` script.
- **Genome V3.1:** Expanded the AI DNA to include strategic policy genes (`recruitBuffer`, `tradeRoiThreshold`, `targetToolRatio`, etc.) and removed "physics" genes (`villagerSpeed`).
- **Fitness Rebalance:** Nerfed Gold (0.1 -> 0.001) and buffed Tier Upgrades (+1000 for Town, +2500 for City, 1.5x Multiplier) to prevent "Miserly Village" behavior.
- **Stability:** Simulations are now robust across dynamic maps and showing Tier 2 (City) upgrades in early generations.

## Key Decisions
- **Decision:** Shifted focus from raw final population to **Median Population** over the entire run to reward resilient growth.
- **Decision:** Restricted UI work to non-simulative components (Layout, Config Viewer, Tooltips) during active GA runs to prevent process corruption.

## TODO
- [ ] Monitor results of the 200-generation marathon.
- [ ] Analyze the "Apex Config" JSON once the run finishes.
- [ ] Apply the winning weights to `DEFAULT_CONFIG` in `GameConfig.ts`.
- [ ] Review PR "V4 Feudal Era: Sovereign AI & Reactive Ants" once merged.
