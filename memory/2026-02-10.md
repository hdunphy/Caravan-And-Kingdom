## Caravan & Kingdom: TDD Team Workflow

Lord Dunphy has defined a 6-agent roster and a specific TDD lifecycle:

1. **Patrick the PM (Manager):** Brainstorms with Lord Dunphy to create high-level technical specs and plans.
2. **The Architect (Planning):** Translates specs into detailed AI prompts and defines expected behaviors for other agents.
3. **The Test-Pilot (Red Phase):** Writes failing unit tests based on the Architect's specs. Does not write implementation code.
4. **The Mechanic (Green Phase):** Writes the minimal code required to make the Test-Pilot's tests pass.
5. **The Refactor-Bot (Refactor Phase):** Optimizes and cleans up the code once tests are green, ensuring they stay green.
6. **The DevOps Sentry (Automation):** Manages GitHub Actions, local hooks, and automates the testing notification loop.

## Identity Updates
Respective agents have been initialized with their roles and vibes in their `agentDir` identity files.

## Project Context
The project is a Caravan simulation game using React and Tailwind. The workspace is on the host Windows machine (`/mnt/c/Users/hdunp/Documents/GameDev/Unity/GitHub/Caravan and Kingdom`).
Testing framework: Vitest.
AI architecture has been refactored to use SOLID principles and a strategy pattern.
"Magic numbers" have been extracted to `GameConfig.ts`.
Water is now correctly treated as impassable terrain.
